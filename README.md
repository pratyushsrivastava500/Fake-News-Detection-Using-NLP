# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP and Streamlit # 
## 📌 Overview ## 
This project is a **Fake News Detection** system using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The system is built using Python and employs machine learning techniques to classify news articles as real or fake. The user interface is developed using Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features ## 
✅ **Machine Learning Model :** Trained using NLP techniques to detect fake news.

🎨 **Streamlit UI :** A user-friendly interface for classifying news articles.

📦 **Pre-trained Model :** Uses a serialized model (model.pkl) for predictions.

🔢 **Vectorization :** Implements a vectorizer (vector.pkl) to transform text input.
